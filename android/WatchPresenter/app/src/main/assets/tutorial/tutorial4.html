        <p>That's it! Now you can control the presentation with your phone</p>
        <p>Simply open the WatchPresenter app on your phone and use the volume buttons to control it.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Volume up: next slide</li>
            <li>Volume down: previous slide</li>
        </ul>

        <p>You can even switch the screen off if you want to save battery and avoid distractions.</p>
        <p>Note: Using the volume buttons while using WatchPresenter does <strong>not</strong> modify the riger volume, so you don't have to worry about that!</p>
